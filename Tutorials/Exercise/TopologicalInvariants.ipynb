    "### Hybrid Wannier Charge centres\n",
    "\n",
    "Topological invariants are calculated in Z2Pack [Gresh2017] using Hybrid Wannier Charge Centres (HWCC), who are defined in terms of Hybrid Wannier Functions (HWF). The difference between HWF and Wannier Functions is that the latter is only localized in one direction (for instance, $x$) and delocalized in the others. In 2D, a Hybrid Wannier Function can be written as: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "|(R_x,k_y), n\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int\\mathrm{d}k_x\\; e^{i k_x R_x}|\\psi_{n,\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The charge centre of an HWF is defined as the average position of the function in the localized direction. The charge centres are defined modulo the lattice vector $a_x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\bar x_n(k_y) = \\langle (R_x,k_y), n | \\hat{x} | (R_x,k_y), n\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "One can think of an HWCC as the charge centre of a Wannier function in a 1D system, coupled to an external parameter $k_y$. In this interpretation, the sum of all HWCCs is directly linked to the 1D electric polarization\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathbf{P}^h_e(k_y) = e \\sum_n \\bar x_n(k_y)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "It should be noted that individual HWCCs are not gauge-invariant. The sum of all HWCCs and $\\mathbf{P}^h_e(k_y)$ are gauge-invariant. \n",
    "\n",
    "### From HWCC to topological invariants\n",
    "#### Chern number\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the HWCCs are defined modulo the lattice vector $R_x$, we can assume periodic boundary conditions $\\bar x(k_y) = \\bar x(k_y) + a_x$. In this way, $\\bar x(k_y)$ can be mapped on a point on the unit circle for any given $k_y$. As $k_y$ goes from 0 to $2\\pi$ the HWCCs and electric polarization $P^h_e$ describe trajectories on a cylinder. The winding number of the trajectory of $P^h_e$ gives the Chern number of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Chern number can also be uniquely associated with any set of **isolated bands** and corresponds to the number of windings of the polarization of the subset of states. The Chern number of the whole system is equal to sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n",

    "#### Time-reversal invariance and the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant\n",
    "\n",
    "Under time-reversal symmetry, the Hilbert space of occupied states can be split into two subspaces which are mapped onto each other by time-reversal. This splits all Kramer pairs into states which are assigned to different subspaces. The Chern number $C_1$, $C_2$ of the subspaces are not uniquely defined and depend on which states are assigned to which subspace. However, as a consequence of the Chern number being odd under time-reversal, the two Chern numbers are always opposite $C_1=-C_2$, i.e. the Chern number of the full system is always zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the two states forming a Kramer pair have to carry opposite Chern numbers. Hence, if the states exchange subspaces, the two Chern numbers can only change by an even number and the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathbb{Z}_2 = (C_1 - C_2)/2 (\\textrm{mod} 2)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "is well defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant is related to the number of times L any line $f(k_y)$ intersects the trajectory of HWCCs in the interval $[0,2\\pi]$. \n",
